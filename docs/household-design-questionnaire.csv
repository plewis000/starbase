Section,Question,Who Should Answer,Why This Matters,Our Recommendation
Discord Structure,"What should we name the Discord server? (e.g., Lewis HQ, Home Base, The Bridge)",Both,"You'll see this name every day. It should feel like yours, not like a tech project.","Something personal — 'Lewis HQ' or 'Home Base' feel right. Avoid anything that sounds like a work Slack."
Discord Structure,"Do you want separate channels per topic (#shopping, #budget, #tasks, #goals) or fewer combined channels?",Lenale (primarily),"More channels = more organized but can feel overwhelming. Fewer channels = simpler but noisier.","Start with 5-6 focused channels. You can always merge or split later. Too few channels means important things get buried."
Discord Structure,"Should the bot respond in the same channel you message it, or should responses go to a dedicated #bot-responses channel?",Both,"In-channel feels conversational. Separate channel keeps things clean but adds friction to read responses.","In-channel. Conversation should feel natural, not like submitting a ticket."
Discord Structure,"Do you want a private DM channel with the bot for personal things (individual goals, private budget questions)?",Both,"Some things you might not want in shared channels — personal habit check-ins, individual spending, etc.","Yes. The bot should respond to DMs as well as channel messages. Shared stuff in channels, personal stuff in DMs."
Discord Structure,"Should the bot post in #logs every time it takes an action (full transparency)?",Both,"Transparency builds trust — you can always see what the bot did. But it can be noisy.","Yes, but make it a channel you can mute. Transparency matters early on while you're learning to trust the system."
Discord Structure,"What channels should have notifications enabled vs. muted by default?",Lenale (primarily),"Discord notification fatigue is real. If everything pings, nothing matters.","Only #command and #shopping should ping. Everything else (briefs, budget, logs) should be muted by default — check when you want to."
Shopping,"How do you currently manage your shopping list? (Shared note, app, paper, texting each other?)",Both,"Understanding current workflow tells us what friction to eliminate. Don't replace something that works.","Whatever you do now, the bot should be strictly easier. If texting 'add milk' to a Discord channel isn't faster than your current method, we've failed."
Shopping,"Should both of you be able to add items, or does one person usually manage the list?",Both,"Determines whether the bot needs to track who added what and whether both get notifications.","Both should be able to add. The bot should say who added what so there's no confusion."
Shopping,"Do you want the bot to remind you of recurring staples? (e.g., 'You usually buy milk every 10 days — need more?')",Both,"Smart reminders reduce forgotten items but can feel naggy if overdone.","Yes, but only after 3+ purchase cycles of data. Don't guess — learn patterns first, then suggest."
Shopping,"Do you shop at multiple stores? Should items be grouped by store?",Both,"If you split shopping across Costco/grocery/specialty, grouping by store saves time in the aisle.","Support it but don't require it. Simple 'add eggs' should just work without specifying a store."
Shopping,"When an item is checked off, should it disappear or stay visible as 'done'?",Lenale (primarily),"Some people like seeing what's been gotten (especially if splitting the shopping trip). Others want a clean list.","Stay visible as checked off during the trip, auto-clear 24 hours after the last item is checked."
Budget & Finance,"How comfortable are you with linking bank accounts to an automated system?",Both,"Plaid is secure (used by Venmo, Robinhood, etc.) but some people have valid concerns about connecting bank data.","Plaid is industry standard and read-only — it cannot move money or make transactions. But both of you should be comfortable before we connect real accounts."
Budget & Finance,"Do you want per-category budgets (dining: $500, groceries: $600) or just total monthly tracking?",Both,"Per-category gives more control but requires more setup. Total spend is simpler but less actionable.","Start with 5-6 major categories (dining, groceries, gas, subscriptions, household, discretionary). You can add more later."
Budget & Finance,"Should the bot alert you when you're approaching a budget limit? At what threshold?",Both,"Proactive alerts prevent overspending but can feel judgmental if badly timed.","Alert at 75% and 90% of monthly budget. Post to #budget channel, not DM — spending is a household topic."
Budget & Finance,"Should spending data be fully shared, or do you each want some private spending visibility?",Both (sensitive topic),"Full transparency is great for shared budgets but some personal spending privacy is healthy.","Have an honest conversation about this. Our recommendation: shared view for joint accounts, individual discretionary spending is private unless you both want it shared."
Budget & Finance,"How often do you want budget summaries? Daily, weekly, or only when asked?",Both,"Daily can feel like micromanagement. Weekly might miss overspending in real-time.","Weekly summary every Sunday evening. Mid-week alert only if you're trending over budget. Daily is too much."
Daily Briefing,"What time should the morning brief post? What time zone?",Both,"Too early = ignored. Too late = useless. Should land when you're actually starting your day.","7:00 AM local time on weekdays, 9:00 AM on weekends. Adjust after a week of use."
Daily Briefing,"What should be in the morning brief? (Calendar, tasks, habits, weather, budget, all of it?)",Both,"The brief should be glanceable — 30 seconds to read. Too much info defeats the purpose.","Calendar + today's tasks + habit check-ins due + weather. Budget only if there's an alert. Keep it under 15 lines."
Daily Briefing,"Should there be an evening check-in? What should it ask?",Both,"Evening nudges help close the loop on habits and tasks but can feel annoying after a long day.","Yes, but gentle. 'You have 2 unchecked habits today — want to log them?' Not 'You failed to complete your habits.'"
Daily Briefing,"Should Lenale get the same brief as Parker, or a customized version?",Both,"You probably have different priorities. Parker may care about goals/habits. Lenale may care about calendar/shopping.","Customized. Each person should configure what shows up in their brief via a simple 'my brief includes...' command."
Tasks,"Should the bot assign tasks to a specific person, or are tasks shared?",Both,"If tasks are personal, you each see your own. If shared, you need assignment and visibility into who's doing what.","Support both. Default is shared/unassigned. Either person can claim or assign. The bot should know who's responsible."
Tasks,"How should the bot handle overdue tasks? Nag? Escalate? Silently reschedule?",Both,"Nagging is annoying but effective. Silent rescheduling hides problems. Need the right balance.","One reminder the day it's due, one nudge the day after. After 3 days overdue, ask 'Should I reschedule this or is it still happening?' No more than that."
Tasks,"Should the bot be able to create tasks from context? (e.g., 'Email from dentist = create dentist appointment task')",Parker (primarily),"Automatic task creation from email/calendar is powerful but can create noise if it guesses wrong.","Not yet. Start with explicit task creation only. Add smart suggestions later once the core loop is trusted."
Goals & Habits,"Should Lenale have her own goals and habits, or is this Parker-only for now?",Both,"If the system is household-wide, Lenale should be able to track her own things too.","Both. Personal goals are private by default. Either person can share a goal to a channel if they want accountability."
Goals & Habits,"How aggressive should habit nudges be? (Gentle reminder vs. 'You haven't done X in 3 days')",Both,"Too soft = ignored. Too aggressive = resented. Tone matters enormously here.","Start gentle. The bot should never make you feel bad. 'Hey, want to check in on meditation today?' not 'You've missed meditation 3 days in a row.' Escalate tone only if explicitly asked to."
Goals & Habits,"Should the bot celebrate streaks and milestones? How?",Both,"Positive reinforcement works. But if it feels fake or excessive it gets annoying fast.","Yes, but sparingly. Celebrate 7-day, 30-day, and 100-day streaks. A simple '🔥 7-day meditation streak!' in the relevant channel. No essays."
Agent Personality,"Should the bot have a name?",Both,"A name makes it feel like a household member vs. a tool. Some people love it, some find it cringe.","Give it a name. It lives in your Discord. 'Starbase' works, or pick something fun together. A named bot feels more natural to talk to."
Agent Personality,"What tone should the bot use? (Formal, casual, playful, minimal?)",Lenale (primarily),"If the tone feels wrong, people stop using it. This is the #1 reason chatbots get abandoned.","Casual but competent. Like a very organized friend, not a corporate assistant. Short sentences. No exclamation marks on everything."
Agent Personality,"Should the bot use emoji?",Both,"Emoji can make messages scannable and friendly, or feel childish depending on taste.","Light emoji for status indicators (✅, ⚠️, 🔥) and channel-appropriate reactions. Not every message needs emoji."
Agent Personality,"When the bot doesn't understand a request, how should it respond?",Both,"Bad error handling kills trust fast. 'I don't understand' with no guidance is frustrating.","Be honest and helpful: 'I'm not sure what you mean. Did you want me to [best guess A] or [best guess B]?' Always offer options, never just fail."
Privacy & Access,"Should Lenale have the same level of access as Parker, or are some things admin-only?",Both (sensitive topic),"Equal access = full partnership. Tiered access = one person controls the system. Both are valid.","Equal access to all shared features. Parker retains admin for system configuration (adding integrations, changing bot behavior). This isn't about trust — it's about not accidentally breaking things."
Privacy & Access,"Should the bot remember and reference personal context? (e.g., 'You mentioned you were stressed about work on Monday')",Both,"Context-awareness makes the agent more helpful but some people find it unsettling.","Yes for factual context (appointments, tasks, goals). No for emotional context — the bot shouldn't play therapist."
Privacy & Access,"Who can add new integrations or change the bot's behavior?",Both,"If either person can reconfigure the system, changes might surprise the other.","Parker manages integrations and system config. Either person can customize their own brief and notification preferences. Changes to shared channels require a heads-up to the other person."
Feedback & Improvement,"How should you submit feedback? (Dedicated command, dedicated channel, DM to bot?)",Both,"The easier it is to give feedback, the more feedback you'll get. The more feedback, the faster the system improves.","All three. Say 'feedback: [thing]' anywhere — in a channel, in a DM, as a command. The bot captures it and posts to #feedback for visibility."
Feedback & Improvement,"Should the bot ask for feedback proactively? (e.g., 'You haven't used shopping in 2 weeks — is it working for you?')",Both,"Proactive feedback prompts surface problems early. But they're annoying if too frequent.","Yes, but maximum once per week, and only about features that seem underused. Easy to dismiss with a 'it's fine' response."
Feedback & Improvement,"How should improvement requests get prioritized?",Both,"Without prioritization, feedback becomes a graveyard of unread requests.","The bot categorizes (bug, feature, improvement) and the weekly review surfaces the top items. Parker makes the final call on what gets built next."
Onboarding,"What's the first thing you want to be able to do with the bot on Day 1?",Lenale (primarily),"First impression matters. If the first interaction is confusing, adoption dies.","Shopping list management. It's shared, it's daily, and 'add milk to the list' is dead simple. Win her over with the easiest feature first."
Onboarding,"How much setup are you willing to do before the bot is useful?",Both,"Some systems require hours of configuration. Others work out of the box. Know your tolerance.","Near zero. The bot should work with sensible defaults from Day 1. Configuration should be optional and incremental — not a prerequisite."
Onboarding,"Would a guided tour be helpful, or do you prefer to just start using it?",Lenale (primarily),"Some people learn by reading instructions. Others learn by doing.","Just start using it. The bot should handle 'help' and 'what can you do?' commands naturally. No mandatory walkthrough."
